# Movie-Streaming-Site-Faculty-Project
 
This project is a web site made as a personalized faculty project where you have to create an account, and you can watch movies and find out certain informations about them.The predominant technologies used in this project are:Xampp and mysql(for movies DB), mongoDB(for users), ejs(viewing-engine), node.js for the backend with JSON parser and passport for the login system.The front end was all CSS, made scallable, with different transitions and animations based on display-width.

# How to Use
The app is all local, use node app.js to start the localhost server and connect to the DB, start xampp and use the .sql script to create the DB and populate it.In the videos folder under public make sure to have the videos downloaded under the specified name in the DB, Then you can access localhost on the port specified and start navigating the site.

# What I Learned

• Working with and parsing JSON objects thorugh HTTP requests.

• Using Express with EJS.

• Creating a log-in system with security implemented, such as sql injection prevention, parsing and coding data through a hash.
